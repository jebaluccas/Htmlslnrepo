                        The time of a woman's life folloWing menopause is called
                        postrmenopause, A woman is considered postrmenopausal
                        if she has not had her period for an entire year, At this point
                        a woman‘s transition into her nonrchildrbearing years is
                        complete Postrmenopause lasts the rest of a woman's life,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this time, many of the bothersome symptoms a
                        woman may have experienced before menopause gradually
                        decrease However, the permanent end of a Woman's
                        period doesn't necessarily mean the end of bothersome
                        menopause symptoms. For about half of women,
                        menopause symptoms Will typically last for about four
                        years after their last period, For 10% of women, symptoms
                        can continue for up to 12 years

                    <p>
                        Along with the physical changes that occur after the menopause, postmenopausal women are at increased risk of a
                        number of health conditions, such as osteoporosis and heart disease

                    <h4>Have I definitely gone through the menopause?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Confirming the menopause has actuain taken place is not easy. Most healthcare professionals Will evaluate a woman's
                        menopausal status according to her symptoms, pattern of periods and medical records
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some women may have had a hysterectomy, and at the same time, surgical removal of the ovaries for various medical
                        reasons, Removal of the ovaries creates an immediate menopause.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What happens to my sex life during the peri-menopause?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most women do not experience major changes in their sex lives during peri-menopause. Some women may notice more
                        vaginal dryness. This is the body's response to a decreased level of oestrogen. Your healthcare professional can discuss
                        options to deal with vaginal dryness, such as over-the-counter lubricants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are concerned, try talking to your partner or family and friends about what you are going through and explain that this
                        is a natural transition towards the menopause.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Vour post-menopausal health</h4>
                    <p>
                        As you get older, your ovaries start producing less of the hormone oestrogen As a result of lower oestrogen levels,
                        postmenopausal women are at increased risk of a number of health conditions such as osteoporosis and heart disease.
                        Medication such as hormone replacement therapy and healthy lifestyle changes can help to reduce the risk of these
                        conditions Every woman is different
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Speak to your healthcare professional about your individual benefits and risks of taking HRT.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Do I still need to see my doctor IIDW that I am post-menopausal?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Even if you are postrmenopausal, getting regular checkrups and preventative screening tests are among the most important
                        things you can do for yourself, How often you need checkrups Will depend on your health history. Talk to your healthcare
                        professional about your individual needs.

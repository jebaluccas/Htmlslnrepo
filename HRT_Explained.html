                        Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective
                        and commonly prescribed treatment for menopausal
                        symptoms. As the name suggests, it replaces the hormone
                        oestrogen that is lost during the menopause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can take HRT as tablets or through a patch or gel on your
                        skin. Women considering HRT have lots of choices! There is
                        not only choice in the type and dose of hormones available,
                        there is also choice in how these hormones are introduced
                        to the body — or what doctors call “the route of delivery".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three main routes - and each will be appropriate
                        for different women:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Via the mouth as a tablet — this is the most common form of HRT</li>
                            <li>Transdermal' (through the skin) methods are less common but still very popular. They can take the form of an adhesive patch, or a gel</li>
                            <li> Finally as an implant injected beneath the skin to provide slow release of oestrogen over several months</li>
                            <li>For vaginal and bladder symptoms, oestrogen can be taken as a small vaginal tablet, cream or vaginal ring inserted within the vagina to provide very "local" relief</li>                           
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h4>What does l-IRT do?</h4>
                    <p>
                        HRT helps to relieve the symptoms caused by oestrogen deﬁciency — such as hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and
                        osteoporosis.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What's right for me?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every woman is an individual and the HRT that will best suit you will depend on your individual circumstances, including
                        your stage in the menopausal process, and whether or not you've had a hysterectomy. Not all HRT treatments are the same;
                        it is essential that you understand both the short and long-term beneﬁts and safety proﬁles of each to ensure that you
                        maintain the best possible health and quality of life at every stage of the menopause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your healthcare professional will discuss the HRT options with you and you both should make a decision based on your
                        individual needs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What's in HRT?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most forms of HRT combine different amounts of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone (manufactured progesterone is
                        called progestogen in the UK).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Oestrogen alone</h4>
                    <p>
                        The core ingredient of all forms of HRT is oestrogen. Oestrogen relieves symptoms such as hot flushes, prevents vaginal
                        symptoms and maintains bone strength.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best HRT for women without a womb (a total hysterectomy) is oestrogen alone. Oestrogen alone can be taken as a daily
                        tablet, a weekly or twice weekly patch, a daily gel or an implant. Varying doses of oestrogen are available.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lower dose varieties aim to reduce the incidence of side effects while maintaining symptom relief and bone strength. It is
                        usually recommended that you take the lowest dose of HRT that will effectively relieve your symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Oestrogen & Progestogen</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have a womb you should be offered HRT that contains both oestrogen and progestogen. This is because oestrogen
                        only HRT can stimulate the lining of the womb (endometrium), leading to excess growth and possibly cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore for women who have not had a hysterectomy, a second hormone is also prescribed (progestogen) to counteract
                        the effects of oestrogen and protect the endometrium. Oestrogen plus progestogen is known as <strong><i> ‘combined HRT’.</i></strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In women who have had a partial hysterectomy (with their cervix intact), some womb lining (endometrium) may still remain,
                        so progestogen may be required with the oestrogen. Talk to your healthcare professional about which HRT would be most
                        suitable for your individual needs.

                    <h4>To bleed or not to bleed</h4>
                    <p>
                        The way in which progestogen is taken along with the oestrogen determines whether or not the HRT will lead to bleeding.
                        Adding progestogen for 10 to 14 days a month, means that a bleed occurs in the days following this course, similar to that


                        of a natural menstrual cycle. This form of <strong><i>'cyclical'</i></strong> or<strong><i> 'sequentiaIHRT’</i></strong> is still used in pen-menopausal women and during the
                        ﬁrst year or two after the menopause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Forms of hormone replacement that give continuous progestogen with the oestrogen have been developed to avoid bleeding
                        altogether. This method is called<strong> <i>‘continuous combined HRT’</i></strong> and is thought to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer even
                        more so than sequential HRT. If you have had at least a year without periods and are thought to be postmenopausal,continuous combined HRT can be used.
